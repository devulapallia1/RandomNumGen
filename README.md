# Test Automation Framework

A robust test automation framework built in Java using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. This framework is designed to test a demo web application that features a random number generator. The framework ensures comprehensive functional testing and integrates modern automation best practices.

## Key Features

### 1. **Modular Design**
- The framework is structured into distinct layers:
  - **Test Scripts**: Contains the test cases for various functionalities.
  - **Utility Functions**: Reusable methods to support test execution.
  - **Test Data**: Externalized test data to ensure flexibility and reusability.

### 2. **Data-Driven Testing**
- Test cases are parameterized using:
  - Excel files
  - JSON files

### 3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
- Supports testing across multiple browsers:
  - Google Chrome
  - Mozilla Firefox
  - Microsoft Edge

### 4. **Reporting**
- Generates detailed HTML reports using TestNG.
- Includes logs for better traceability of test results.

### 5. **CI/CD Integration**
- Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions for automated test execution.
- Enables continuous feedback on code changes.

## Files in the Project

### 1. `RandomNumGen.java`
- Implements the logic for generating random numbers in the demo web application.

### 2. `RandomNumJUnit.java`
- Contains JUnit test cases for validating the random number generator.

### 3. `RandomNumTestNG.java`
- Contains TestNG test cases to ensure broader testing functionality and supports advanced features like parallel execution.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd test-automation-framework
   ```

3. Install dependencies and configure the environment as needed.

4. Run the TestNG test cases:
